# &rarr; **User Experience (UX)**

### **<u>Scope</u>**

The scope of this app is to create a platform where gamers from all platforms, backgrounds and ages can share their honest opinions on their favourite video games or read the opinions posted by their peers.

Moreover the app caters to the administrator by providing an array of tools in order to oversee content posted by the users and to be able to update the app with more categories (genres and gaming platforms).

By completing this project I felt my gained experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript coming together, and by working with them furthered my control and mastery of Python+Flask and MongoDB. 

The project provides all tiers of users <u>CRUD</u> functionality on their and the apps data, giving them the tools to create, search, sort, view, edit and delete reviews and categories (admin users only).

### **<u>Wireframes</u>**

As part of the design process, before starting my project I made initial wireframes using [Lucidchart](https://lucidchart.com). Creating these mock-ups helped me plan the basic structure and arrangement of the features for my site.

The final design has been influenced by mentor and user feedback so the wireframes map the journey from idea to functioning app.

- [Homepage](static/assets/images/readme/pdfs/home.pdf)
- [Create account page](static/assets/images/readme/pdfs/create-account.pdf)
- [Log in page](static/assets/images/readme/pdfs/log-in.pdf)
- [Reviews page](static/assets/images/readme/pdfs/reviews-visitor.pdf)
- [Add/Edit review page](static/assets/images/readme/pdfs/add-edit-review.pdf)
- [Read review page visitor view](static/assets/images/readme/pdfs/read-review-visitor.pdf)
- [Read review page user view](static/assets/images/readme/pdfs/read-review-user.pdf)
- [Mobile view](static/assets/images/readme/pdfs/mobile.pdf)
- [Tablet view](static/assets/images/readme/pdfs/tablet.pdf)


### **<u>Design</u>**

**Structure**

- A simple design structure with a fixed navbar, a dropdown side navigation menu accessible from every page and a fixed footer. A brand logo is displayed in the top left of the screen to allow easy navigation back to the homepage.

- As a mobile first site I contained the logo, login button and nav menu icon centered by two spaces creating a core towards the center of the page. This helps keep the design consistent as it moves from smaller to larger viewports.

- As well as including a title tag on my base.html, I have also added the meta description tag to help optimize my click-through rate from search engine result pages.

**Colour palette**

- The #e0e0e0 shade of grey has been used for the main background throughout the site with all the forms using a #fafafa shade of white creating a slight contrast.

- The #616161 shade of grey has been used as a background for the navbar as well as the colour of various UI buttons throughout the site. 

- The #fb8c00 shade of orange has been used as the colour for title text throughout the website, as well as the color of more prominent callouts and buttons.

- I decided on this high contrast colour scheme as the colours work well with the subject matter of the website. 

<img src="static/assets/images/readme/palette.png">

**Typography**

- The main font used throughout the site is 'Roboto' which belongs to the sans-serif typeface family. The font is clean and elegant, making it a good choice for web design.

- I have used the 'Orbitron' font to create the 'uReview' logo as it pairs well with my overall branding. Moreover it has been used as the font for titles and fonts all over the site.

- The greater than (>) and lower than (<) symbols have been used creatively to form icons for various action buttons throughout the site. That helps mix-up the use of [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons and re-inforces the site's branding.

- Sans Serif is set as the fallback font if for any reason the main fonts aren't being imported into the site correctly.


**Logo Design**

- I created my own logo design with inspiration from old school operating systems. Using the greater than symbol  to create a simple but effective logo.

- Following website conventions, my website logo is a link to the homepage. Over time many people have learned that clicking on a site’s logo leads them back to the homepage so adopting this standard reduces confusion by matching the UI to users’ expectations. The logo is also left-aligned which is the most familiar placement, and is where users look to find it.


### <u>**User stories**</u>

<img src="static/assets/images/readme/site-map.png">

**Visitor UX:**

* As a visitor I want to be able to easily browse and find reviews from the home page.

* As a visitor I don't want to have to make an account so as to experience content in the app. 

* As a visitor I want to be able to sort and search posted reviews based on a categories or keywords. 


**Registered User UX**

* As a registered user I want to be able to easily find how I can register in order to post a review. 

* As a registered user I want to be able to add my review easily. 

* As a registered user I want to be able to see a collection of my psoted reviews easily.

* As a registered user I want to be able to edit and delete my reviews. 

* As a registered user I want to see new content first on consequtive site visits. 

 
**Administrator User UX**

* As an administrator I want to be able to easily delete any review.

* As an administrator I want to be able to add new genres and platforms.

* As an administrator I want to be able to delete existing genres and platforms.

* As an administrator I want to easily manage both categories from one screen.

 > **Note**: The user stories are tested in [testing.md](https://github.com/NikolasKotsikos/uReview/blob/master/testing.md).

## &rarr; **Database Architecture**

<img src="static/assets/images/readme/db-schema.png">

- **Collections**

    The uReview database on MongoDB features 4 collections:
    > **Note**: All collection contain the "_id" key whose valuew is the ObjectId item that contains a string.
        
     * The genres collection, which contains the key "genre_name" whose value is a string.

     * The platforms collection, which contains the keys "platform_name" and "img_url" whose values are strings.

     * The reviews collection, which contains the keys "review_name", "genre_name", "platform", "dev_name", "release_year", "img_url", "review_text" and "created_by". All of these keys have a string as their value.

     * The users collection, which contains the "username" key which has a string as a value and the "password" key that has a string that has been hashed and salted by Werkzeug.

## &rarr; **Deployment**

#### Deploy to Heroku

The project was connected to Heroku using automatic deployment from my GitPod repository, using the following steps...

> **Note:** Before following the below steps ensure you have already created your new repo in Github and set up an env.py file to store your sensitive data. (Further details on adding an env.py file below)

1. In the terminal create requirements.txt and Procfile files using the commands below:
   - $ pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

   - $ echo web: python app.py > Procfile

   > **Note:** 
The **P**rocfile must be assigned a capital P.

2. Log in (or Register) to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and from your dashboard click 'new' > 'create new app'.

3. Enter your 'App name' and choose the appropriate region, then click 'Create app'.
   > **Note:** 
 The app name must be unique, all lowercase, and '-' to be used instead of spaces.
The region chosen should be the one closest to you.

4. From the Heroku deploy tab, select the Deployment method 'GitHub'.

5. On the 'Connect to GitHub' section make sure your GitHub profile is displayed then add your repository name and click 'Search'.

   > **Note:** 
This is the name of your repo in GitHub. It is good practice to use an identical name for your Heroku app.

6. Your repo should now be displayed below, click 'Connect' to connect to this app.

7. Go to the Settings tab on Heroku, scroll to the 'Config Vars' section, and click 'Reveal Config Vars'. 

   Enter variables (key and value) contained in the env.py file. The keys are listed below and values are inputted by the user.
    - IP
    - PORT
    - SECRET_KEY
    - MONGO_URI
    - MONGO_DBNAME

8. Push requirements.txt and Procfile to the repository.

9. Go to the Deploy tab on Heroku and under the Automatic deployment section, click 'Enable Automatic Deploys'. Then under Manual deploy click 'Deploy Branch'.

   - Heroku will now receive the code from GitHub and start building the app using the required packages.
   - Once built you will receive the message 'Your app was successfully deployed' and you can click 'View' to launch your new app.

        > **Note:** 
        In Manual deploy dropdown 'master' is selected'

#### Accessing code

Follow the steps below if you are wanting to propose changes to the project or to use the project as a starting point for your own idea.

- **Forking the GitHub Repository**

  Forking allows you to create a copy of the original repository and propose changes to the repository owner via a pull request.

  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.

  2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button.

  3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

- **Making a Local Clone**

When you clone a repository, the repository is copied on to your local machine.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
   - uReview repository can be found [here](https://github.com/NikolasKotsikos/uReview)

2. Under the repository name, click the "download code" option.   

3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.   

4. Open Git Bash

5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ureview.git
    ```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

      Now, you have a local copy of your fork of the uReview repository.

    > **Note:** The repository name and output numbers that you see on your computer, representing the total file size, etc, may differ from the example I have provided above.

8. Add an env.py file to your workspace to include your environment variables (more details below).

   > **Note:** Contact the site owner if you want more information on the environment variables that have been included.

**Creating env.py file** 

1. Add a env.py file to store environment variables:
   - Import os 
   - os.environ.setdefault("IP", "To be added by user") 
   - os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "To be added by user") 
   - os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "To be added by user") 
   - os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "To be added by user") 
   - os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "To be added by user")

    > **Note:** I used [RandomKeygen.com](https://randomkeygen.com/) to get my secure SECRET_KEY password. A SECRET_KEY is required when using the flash and session functions of Flask.

 2. Create a file named .gitignore and include env.py to ensure this file is never pushed to GitHub.
    > **Note:** The env.py mustn't be tracked as any GitHub user can access your confidential data.
